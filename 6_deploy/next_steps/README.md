# Next Steps
Congratulations! You just completed the last module of the D-Wise framework!

Assuming that you already know how to build soling engines, now you have 
everything you need to develop professional solutions to solve real-world 
problems with advanced analytics. If you don't have practice with building 
solve engines, your Mip Mentor can guide you to the next steps.

If you have made this far in the Mip Go program without the support of a 
Mip Mentor, you deserve a huge congratulation! We would love to hear about your 
experience and see if we can give you further opportunities to continue 
growing in your career. Please get in touch with us: https://www.mipwise.
