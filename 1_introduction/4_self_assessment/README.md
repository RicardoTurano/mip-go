# Self-Assessment

We don't believe that everyone should be doing the same thing, studying the 
same content in the same order and at the same time, solving the exact same 
problems in the exact same way. There must be some reasonable degree of 
freedom. It doesn't have to be too much freedom. It only has to be enough 
for you to steer what you do towards the things that interest you the most,
that leverage your skills, the things that you are good at doing. Because 
that's when you give your best and achieve what you want.

So you need to know what you want, what your interests and strengths are.

To help you to identify these things (and perhaps learn something new about 
yourself today), we  have put together a couple of questions for you to answer. 
Please answer them to yourself. And write down your answers as completely 
as you can. If you feel like you want to write a complete essay for each 
question, go for it! And don't feel pressured to answer them all in one go, 
take your time.

1. What prompted you to take the Mip Go program and what are you keen to accomplish throughout this program?
2. What are the things you would probably do for free, but it would be great if you could get paid for?
3. What are the things that you consider yourself good at and what makes you think so?
4. Suppose you no longer had to worry about money, what would you do with your life?
5. Role models are people that we aspire to be like them, at least in some aspects. 
   List some of your role models (if any) and what you admire in them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider discussing your answers to these questions with your Mip Mentor. 
It may be a good time to schedule a one-one section with him/her to discuss 
and plan your training track anyway.

Turano answers:

1. I'm starting as a trainee in MipWise and
I think I'll be more comfortable using my math
knowledge on real world problems at the end of 
this process.

2. Research about optimization methods, learn
new programming tools and discuss real world 
problems with cool people.

3. I think I'm good at abstracting daily problems
and transforming them into math optimization 
problems. Also,  I think I'm good at dealing
with people. In both cases I've experienced 
situations where I've handled the problems
that colleagues had trouble dealing with.

4. I have no idea, because many things that have
interest to do in my free time would get boring quickly
because I could do them every time. But, I think
that with enough free time I would start to study 
more about math, programming, politics and philosophy.
Also, I would have more time to spend with friends
and family (probably I would build more discussion groups).

5. I do not have any role model, but I have
a role group. I would like to be more the average
of the people in the Philosophy History group that I'm in.
I love the different perspective about: life, 
science, nature, being human, spirituality
and everything that they have. Learning with
them make me feel more alive.
